# WebDev Flashcards
Welcome to WebDev Flashcards! The origins of this project are to help aspiring or current developers brush up on concepts, theories, or jargon commonly used in web development.<br/>
This project is in its infancy and will be continuously evolving and growing. If you’re a developer (of <b>ANY</b> skill level) who’d like to get involved then check out the ‘Getting Involved’ section.

## Where did we get this idea from
Following graduation from Coding Dojo’s coding bootcamp and attempting to enter the industry, I felt that while my hard coding skills were up to par, some of my knowledge around theories or terminology was lacking. I thought to myself:  “What better way to remedy this, than to build an application to solve this problem!”

When I mentioned the idea to Coren, the idea resonated with him as well. We immediately started collaborating to get the groundwork deployed to a (free) publicly available site and begin work on building out the flashcard database so we can be more well rounded developers.

## Getting Involved
If you’d like to get involved in helping to build out this application, then reach out to Mack or Coren on LinkedIn by sending either of us a message. We primarily collaborate through Discord when building this out, so you’ll need that as well! 
Regardless of skill level, we’d love to have you join in any capacity!

<!-- TODO: Incorporate first contirbution instructions, or link to them somewhere -->

## Technologies Used
This project is build with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, React) and is hosted publicly on Vercel.
The database of flashcards is community built and maintained.

## Setup
This is a MERN stack application, so the dependencies are located in the package.json files.<br/>
This project is actually utilizing 2 deployments on Vercel currently. One to handle the frontend and another deployment to handle the backend. <br/> 
(Client folder == frontend | Server folder == backend)<br/>
<!-- TODO: Will describe process to fork and run locally once the dev | | localhost feature is added to project -->

## Usage
You can view and practice your knowledge at the following: https://webdev-flashcards.vercel.app/.<br/> 
Feel free to explore and let us know what you think!

## Room for Improvement
  - We have a running google doc of things we’re working on, and features or fixes we’d like to implement. You can view that google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCxL-ObpanxA-0_K81IMbNgWlwDwPS5SKxNcyhSYlw0/edit).
